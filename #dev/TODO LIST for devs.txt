RULE OVER ZOVERWRITE -> Firerozes copied last 4 declarations that weren't in zoverwrite to zoverwrite, will close the problem on next update

WTF are "flavor12_ara" and "infanted_aragon_eventpicture" declarations in zoverwrite generic ?

three .png were deleted : check if nothing was disturbed at the next update

ideagroups.1919 is messed up
