———————————— The Great Exhibition Mod for Europa Universalis 4 ———————————

[h1]Description:[/h1]

The Great Exhibition Mod adds many new pictures to events. The images dynamically change depending on your culture, religion or location, providing unique flavour for your games. The mod is based on another modification, the Vanilla'd - The Grand Exhibition, made by Tinholt. However, since he decided to leave the modding scene, further development of his project will take place on this page. Originally, TGE was updated by Aetherum since no one else was interested in updating the mod for the 1.30 version of the vanilla game. However, now a group of talented modders, which names you can see in the Credits section, is also working on this project, constantly introducing new content. We do hope that this mod becomes one of your favourite ones, as it becomes for its developers!
