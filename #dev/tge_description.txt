———————————— The Great Exhibition Mod for Europa Universalis 4 ———————————

[h1]Description:[/h1]

This modification adds many new pictures to events that change depending on your culture, religion or location. It is based on the Vanilla'd - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943561459]The Grand Exhibition[/url] - made by Tinholt. However, since he decided to leave the modding scene, further development of his project will take place on this page. I originally picked this mod since no one was updating it for 1.30, as I enjoyed it a lot while playing my pre 1.30 games with it. Hope you will like it too now!
